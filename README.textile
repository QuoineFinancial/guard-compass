h1. Guard Compass Plug-in

Let you configure a Guard that will run compass whenever a stylesheet is updated.

h2. Quick Start

bc. $ (sudo) gem install compass
$ compass -f blueprint my_compass_project
$ cd my_compass_project
$ bundle init

Then, edit the Gemfile for it to looks like:

bc. source "http://rubygems.org"
gem 'guard-compass'

You can now download missing gems and initialize the guard

bc. $ bundle install
$ guard init
$ guard init compass
$ guard

Your scss(or sass) stylesheets are now guarded.

h2. Configure Guard::Compass plug-in

The default configuration generated by 'guard init compass' looks like this

bc. guard 'compass' do
  watch('^src/(.*)\.s[ac]ss')
end

the compass guard accept two options:

 * :workdir: all compass relative path will be computed from there
 * :configuration_file: relative or absolute path to your compass configuration file

By default, the working directory is the folder where you run guard in and
the configuration_file is computed by compass
